# How to use? 
- As you see, the shell command is a simple yet. It is based on regtest in bitcoind. So this shell just use it.

- Note that you should make a new diretory in this shell, default is 'uki' Or just use ~/.bitcoin/. But you have to delete 'datadir' tag!!

# Plan to do

- And kind of configuration things.
